# Infrastructure Management for Deep Learning Notes

## Traefik

Traefik is a modern HTTP reverse proxy and load balancer that integrates seamlessly with containerized environments, making it ideal for managing deep learning model deployments.

**Key Concepts:**

- Dynamic configuration
- Automatic service discovery
- Load balancing
- SSL termination
- Middleware for request modification

**Best Practices for Deep Learning Infrastructure:**

1. **Service Discovery:**

   - Use Traefik's auto-discovery to detect new model versions automatically
   - Label your containers to control routing and load balancing

2. **Load Balancing:**

   - Implement canary deployments for gradual model rollouts
   - Use weighted round-robin for A/B testing different model versions

3. **SSL Termination:**

   - Configure automatic SSL with Let's Encrypt for secure model endpoints
   - Use TLS for all medical imaging data transfers

4. **Middleware:**

   - Implement rate limiting to prevent API abuse
   - Use authentication middleware to secure model endpoints

5. **Health Checks:**

   - Configure health checks to ensure only healthy model instances receive traffic

**Example Traefik Configuration for Deep Learning:**

```yaml
http:
  routers:
    mri-segmentation:
      rule: "Host(`mri.example.com`) && PathPrefix(`/segment`)"
      service: mri-segmentation
      middlewares:
        - auth
        - ratelimit
  services:
    mri-segmentation:
      loadBalancer:
        servers:
          - url: "http://mri-model-v1:8080"
          - url: "http://mri-model-v2:8080"
        healthCheck:
          path: /health
          interval: "10s"
  middlewares:
    auth:
      basicAuth:
        users:
          - "admin:$apr1$H6uskkkW$IgXLP6ewTrSuBkTrqE8wj/"
    ratelimit:
      rateLimit:
        average: 100
        burst: 50
```

## Prometheus

Prometheus is an open-source monitoring and alerting toolkit, essential for observing deep learning model performance and infrastructure health.

**Key Concepts:**

- Time series data collection
- PromQL (Prometheus Query Language)
- Alerting rules
- Service discovery

**Best Practices for Deep Learning Monitoring:**

1. **Metrics Collection:**

   - Expose custom metrics for model inference time, accuracy, and throughput
   - Use the Prometheus client library in your deep learning services

2. **Service Discovery:**

   - Utilize Prometheus' Kubernetes service discovery for dynamic environments
   - Label your services for easier metric aggregation and querying

3. **Alerting:**

   - Set up alerts for model performance degradation
   - Configure alerts for infrastructure issues (GPU utilization, memory usage)

4. **Data Retention:**

   - Adjust retention periods based on your compliance requirements for medical data

5. **Federation:**

   - Implement Prometheus federation for large-scale, multi-cluster deployments

**Example Prometheus Configuration for Deep Learning:**

```yaml
global:
  scrape_interval: 15s

scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'mri-segmentation'
    kubernetes_sd_configs:
      - role: pod
    relabel_configs:
      - source_labels: [__meta_kubernetes_pod_label_app]
        regex: mri-segmentation
        action: keep

rule_files:
  - 'alert_rules.yml'

alerting:
  alertmanagers:
  - static_configs:
    - targets:
      - alertmanager:9093
```

**Example Alert Rules:**

```yaml
groups:
- name: deep_learning_alerts
  rules:
  - alert: HighInferenceLatency
    expr: avg(model_inference_time_seconds) > 0.5
    for: 5m
    labels:
      severity: warning
    annotations:
      summary: "High inference latency detected"
  - alert: LowModelAccuracy
    expr: avg(model_accuracy) < 0.95
    for: 10m
    labels:
      severity: critical
    annotations:
      summary: "Model accuracy below threshold"
```

## Integrating Traefik and Prometheus in Deep Learning Workflow

1. **Deployment:**

   - Use Traefik to route traffic to different model versions
   - Expose Prometheus metrics endpoint in your deep learning services

2. **Monitoring:**

   - Configure Prometheus to scrape metrics from Traefik and your model services
   - Use PromQL to create dashboards for model performance and infrastructure health

3. **Scaling:**

   - Use Traefik's load balancing to distribute traffic across scaled model instances
   - Monitor scaling events and their impact on performance using Prometheus metrics

4. **A/B Testing:**

   - Implement traffic splitting in Traefik for A/B testing different model versions
   - Use Prometheus to collect and compare performance metrics of different versions

5. **Alerting:**

   - Set up Prometheus alerting for both infrastructure and model-specific issues
   - Configure Traefik to route alerts to appropriate teams or services

## Medical Imaging Specific Considerations

1. **Data Privacy:**

   - Implement strict access controls in Traefik for all medical imaging endpoints
   - Ensure all metrics collected by Prometheus are anonymized and compliant with HIPAA

2. **High Availability:**

   - Configure Traefik for high availability to ensure continuous access to critical diagnostic models
   - Set up Prometheus in a highly available configuration to prevent monitoring gaps

3. **Resource Management:**

   - Use Traefik to intelligently route requests based on resource availability (e.g., GPU utilization)
   - Monitor resource usage with Prometheus to optimize infrastructure for different imaging modalities

4. **Latency Monitoring:**

   - Implement custom Prometheus metrics for end-to-end latency of image processing pipelines
   - Use Traefik's metrics to monitor network latency for large image file transfers

5. **Compliance Logging:**

   - Configure Traefik to log all access attempts for audit purposes
   - Use Prometheus to monitor and alert on any unusual access patterns or potential data breaches
