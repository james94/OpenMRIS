# Ansible Development for Medical Imaging AI Infrastructure Notes

## 1. Ansible Basics for Medical Imaging

- **Inventory Management:**

  - Group imaging servers by modality (e.g., MRI, CT, PET, SPECT)
  - Use dynamic inventory for cloud-based imaging resources

- **Playbook Structure:**

  - Create separate playbooks for different imaging modalities
  - Use roles for common tasks (e.g., DICOM server setup, image processing)

- **Variables:**

  - Store sensitive information (e.g., PACS credentials) in Ansible Vault
  - Use group_vars for modality-specific configurations

## 2. Infrastructure as Code (IaC) for Imaging Systems

- **DICOM Server Deployment:**

  ```yaml
  - name: Deploy DICOM server
    hosts: dicom_servers
    roles:
      - dicom_server
      - network_config
      - security_hardening
  ```

- **Image Processing Cluster Setup:**

  ```yaml
  - name: Set up image processing cluster
    hosts: processing_nodes
    roles:
      - gpu_drivers
      - cuda_toolkit
      - deep_learning_frameworks
  ```

## 3. Data Pipeline Automation

- **Data Ingestion:**

  ```yaml
  - name: Configure data ingestion pipeline
    hosts: ingestion_servers
    tasks:
      - name: Install DICOM listeners
      - name: Configure HL7 interfaces
      - name: Set up data validation checks
  ```

- **Data Preprocessing:**

  ```yaml
  - name: Set up preprocessing pipeline
    hosts: preprocessing_servers
    roles:
      - image_normalization
      - artifact_removal
      - data_anonymization
  ```

## 4. AI Model Deployment

- **Model Server Configuration:**

  ```yaml
  - name: Deploy AI model servers
    hosts: model_servers
    roles:
      - tensorflow_serving
      - model_versioning
      - load_balancing
  ```

- **Inference Pipeline Setup:**

  ```yaml
  - name: Configure inference pipeline
    hosts: inference_nodes
    tasks:
      - name: Install inference libraries
      - name: Set up result logging
      - name: Configure PACS integration
  ```

## 5. Monitoring and Logging

- **Prometheus and Grafana Setup:**

  ```yaml
  - name: Deploy monitoring stack
    hosts: monitoring_servers
    roles:
      - prometheus
      - grafana
      - alertmanager
  ```

- **Log Aggregation:**

  ```yaml
  - name: Configure centralized logging
    hosts: all
    roles:
      - filebeat
      - elasticsearch
      - kibana
  ```

## 6. Security and Compliance

- **HIPAA Compliance:**

  ```yaml
  - name: Ensure HIPAA compliance
    hosts: all
    roles:
      - encrypt_data_at_rest
      - audit_logging
      - access_control
  ```

- **Network Security:**

  ```yaml
  - name: Configure network security
    hosts: all
    tasks:
      - name: Set up firewalls
      - name: Configure VPN access
      - name: Implement network segmentation
  ```

## 7. Disaster Recovery and Backup

- **Backup Configuration:**

  ```yaml
  - name: Set up automated backups
    hosts: storage_servers
    roles:
      - backup_scheduler
      - offsite_replication
  ```

- **Disaster Recovery:**

  ```yaml
  - name: Configure disaster recovery
    hosts: dr_sites
    roles:
      - data_sync
      - failover_setup
  ```

## 8. Integration with Other Tools

- **Jenkins Integration:**

  ```yaml
  - name: Set up CI/CD pipeline
    hosts: jenkins_servers
    roles:
      - jenkins_installation
      - ansible_plugin_setup
  ```

- **Kubernetes Integration:**

  ```yaml
  - name: Configure Kubernetes cluster
    hosts: k8s_nodes
    roles:
      - k8s_installation
      - helm_setup
      - imaging_operators
  ```

## 9. Best Practices for Medical Imaging

- Use idempotent tasks to ensure consistent state
- Implement rolling updates for zero-downtime deployments
- Regularly test disaster recovery playbooks
- Use Ansible Tower for centralized management and auditing
- Implement version control for all Ansible code
- Use Ansible Lint to ensure code quality and best practices

## 10. Performance Optimization

- Use async tasks for long-running operations
- Implement SSH multiplexing for faster execution
- Use `become` judiciously to minimize privilege escalation
- Optimize fact gathering with `gather_subset`
