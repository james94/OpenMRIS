  - Use MapR Streams for real-time ingestion of imaging data from medical devices
  - Leverage MapR Database for storing and indexing imaging metadata

## 5. Jupyter Notebooks

- **Collaborative Development:**

  - Set up JupyterHub for multi-user notebook environments
  - Use version control integration for notebook versioning

- **Workflow Development:**

  - Develop and document image processing pipelines in notebooks
  - Implement parameterized notebooks for reusable analysis workflows

## 6. R (RStudio)

- **Statistical Analysis:**

  - Use R for statistical analysis of imaging biomarkers
  - Implement machine learning models for image classification and segmentation

- **Visualization:**

  - Develop custom visualizations for medical imaging data using ggplot2
  - Create interactive dashboards with Shiny for radiologists

## 7. GPU Setup

- **CUDA Configuration:**

  - Install and configure CUDA toolkit for GPU-accelerated computing
  - Set up GPU monitoring tools (e.g., nvidia-smi) for resource tracking

- **Deep Learning Frameworks:**

  - Install and configure GPU-enabled versions of TensorFlow and PyTorch
  - Implement multi-GPU training for large-scale medical imaging models

## 8. Harvest (assuming you mean data harvesting)

- **Data Ingestion:**

  - Develop data connectors for various imaging modalities and PACS systems
  - Implement data validation and quality checks during ingestion

- **Metadata Extraction:**

  - Extract DICOM metadata and store in a searchable database
  - Implement privacy-preserving techniques for sensitive patient information

## Data Engineering Lifecycle Integration

   - Use MapR Streams for real-time data ingestion
   - Implement Kubernetes jobs for scheduled data harvesting from PACS

2. **Data Storage:**

   - Store raw imaging data in MapR-FS
   - Use Apache Drill to query and explore stored data

3. **Data Processing:**

   - Develop Spark jobs using Livy for distributed image processing
   - Use GPU-enabled nodes in Kubernetes for compute-intensive tasks

4. **Data Analysis:**

   - Utilize Jupyter Notebooks for exploratory data analysis
   - Implement R scripts for statistical analysis of imaging biomarkers

5. **Model Development:**

   - Use GPU-enabled environments for training deep learning models
   - Develop and test models in Jupyter Notebooks

6. **Model Deployment:**

   - Deploy models as Kubernetes services
   - Use Rancher for managing model deployments across environments

7. **Monitoring and Optimization:**

   - Implement Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring Kubernetes clusters
   - Use GPU monitoring tools to optimize resource utilization

## Best Practices for Medical Imaging AI Infrastructure
