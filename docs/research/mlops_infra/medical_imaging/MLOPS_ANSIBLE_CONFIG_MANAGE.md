# MLOps Configuration Management Notes: Ansible Development

We'll go through notes focusing on Ansible development for MLOps in medical imaging AI, incorporating Yarn and YAML, and explain load balancing with HAProxy versus Traefik and Prometheus integration. These notes are tailored for healthcare organizations.

## 1. Ansible Basics for MLOps

- Install Ansible:

  ```
  pip install ansible
  ```

- Create an inventory file (`hosts.yml`):

  ```yaml
  all:
    children:
      ml_servers:
        hosts:
          mri_server:
            ansible_host: 192.168.1.10
          ct_server:
            ansible_host: 192.168.1.11
  ```

- Basic playbook structure (`ml_setup.yml`):

  ```yaml
  - name: Setup ML environment
    hosts: ml_servers
    tasks:
      - name: Install Python packages
        pip:
          name:
            - tensorflow
            - pytorch
            - nibabel
          state: present
  ```

## 2. Integrating Yarn with Ansible

- Install Yarn via Ansible:

  ```yaml
  - name: Install Yarn
    npm:
      name: yarn
      global: yes
  ```

- Manage ML project dependencies:

  ```yaml
  - name: Install ML project dependencies
    yarn:
      path: /path/to/ml_project
  ```

## 3. Managing YAML Configs with Ansible

- Template YAML config (`ml_config.yml.j2`):

  ```yaml
  model:
    name: {{ model_name }}
    input_shape: [{{ input_width }}, {{ input_height }}, {{ input_channels }}]
  training:
    batch_size: {{ batch_size }}
    epochs: {{ epochs }}
  ```

- Deploy config with Ansible:

  ```yaml
  - name: Deploy ML config
    template:
      src: ml_config.yml.j2
      dest: /etc/ml/config.yml
  ```

## 4. MLOps Lifecycle Management

a. Data Preparation:

```yaml
- name: Prepare training data
  ansible.builtin.command:
    cmd: python preprocess_dicom.py
    chdir: /path/to/data_prep
```

b. Model Training:

```yaml
- name: Train ML model
  ansible.builtin.shell:
    cmd: yarn run train
    chdir: /path/to/ml_project
  environment:
    CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES: "0,1"
```

c. Model Evaluation:

```yaml
- name: Evaluate model
  ansible.builtin.command:
    cmd: python evaluate_model.py
    chdir: /path/to/evaluation
```

d. Model Deployment:

```yaml
- name: Deploy model to production
  ansible.builtin.copy:
    src: /path/to/trained_model.h5
    dest: /opt/ml/models/
  notify: Restart ML service
```

e. Monitoring:

```yaml
- name: Setup Prometheus for model monitoring
  ansible.builtin.template:
    src: prometheus.yml.j2
    dest: /etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml
  notify: Restart Prometheus
```

## 5. Load Balancing in Configuration Management with HAProxy (Approach A)

To account for load balancing in your MLOps configuration management:

a. Install and configure a load balancer (e.g., HAProxy):

```yaml
- name: Install HAProxy
  ansible.builtin.apt:
    name: haproxy
    state: present

- name: Configure HAProxy for ML model serving
  ansible.builtin.template:
    src: haproxy.cfg.j2
    dest: /etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg
  notify: Restart HAProxy
```

b. HAProxy configuration template (`haproxy.cfg.j2`):

```
frontend ml_frontend
    bind *:80
    default_backend ml_backend

backend ml_backend
    balance roundrobin
    server mri_server 192.168.1.10:8000 check
    server ct_server 192.168.1.11:8000 check
```

c. Dynamic backend configuration:

```yaml
- name: Get active ML servers
  ansible.builtin.set_fact:
    active_servers: "{{ groups['ml_servers'] | map('extract', hostvars, ['ansible_host']) | list }}"

- name: Update HAProxy config
  ansible.builtin.template:
    src: haproxy_dynamic.cfg.j2
    dest: /etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg
  vars:
    backend_servers: "{{ active_servers }}"
  notify: Restart HAProxy
```

d. Monitor load balancer health:

```yaml
- name: Check HAProxy status
  ansible.builtin.command: haproxy -c -f /etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg
  register: haproxy_status
  changed_when: false

- name: Display HAProxy status
  ansible.builtin.debug:
    var: haproxy_status.stdout_lines
```

By integrating Ansible with Yarn and YAML configurations, you can create a robust MLOps pipeline for medical imaging AI. This approach allows for consistent environment setup, automated model training and deployment, and efficient load balancing across your ML infrastructure.

Also remember to emphasize how this configuration management approach ensures reproducibility, scalability, and reliability in medical imaging AI systems. Highlight the importance of load balancing in handling varying workloads, especially in critical healthcare applications where high availability and performance are crucial.


## 5. Load Balancing with Traefik and Prometheus Integration (Approach B)

To account for load balancing in your MLOps configuration management using Traefik and Prometheus:

```yaml
# Install Traefik
- name: Install Traefik
  ansible.builtin.get_url:
    url: https://github.com/traefik/traefik/releases/download/v2.5.3/traefik_v2.5.3_linux_amd64.tar.gz
    dest: /tmp/traefik.tar.gz

- name: Extract Traefik
  ansible.builtin.unarchive:
    src: /tmp/traefik.tar.gz
    dest: /usr/local/bin
    remote_src: yes

# Configure Traefik
- name: Configure Traefik
  ansible.builtin.template:
    src: traefik.yml.j2
    dest: /etc/traefik/traefik.yml
  notify: Restart Traefik

# Traefik configuration template (traefik.yml.j2)
entryPoints:
  web:
    address: ":80"
  metrics:
    address: ":8080"

providers:
  file:
    directory: /etc/traefik/dynamic
    watch: true

api:
  insecure: true

metrics:
  prometheus:
    entryPoint: metrics

# Dynamic configuration for ML services
- name: Configure ML services in Traefik
  ansible.builtin.template:
    src: ml_services.yml.j2
    dest: /etc/traefik/dynamic/ml_services.yml
  notify: Reload Traefik

# ML services configuration (ml_services.yml.j2)
http:
  routers:
    mri-model:
      rule: "Host(`mri.example.com`)"
      service: mri-service
    ct-model:
      rule: "Host(`ct.example.com`)"
      service: ct-service

  services:
    mri-service:
      loadBalancer:
        servers:
          - url: "http://{{ hostvars['mri_server']['ansible_host'] }}:8000"
    ct-service:
      loadBalancer:
        servers:
          - url: "http://{{ hostvars['ct_server']['ansible_host'] }}:8000"

# Install Prometheus
- name: Install Prometheus
  ansible.builtin.get_url:
    url: https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/releases/download/v2.30.3/prometheus-2.30.3.linux-amd64.tar.gz
    dest: /tmp/prometheus.tar.gz

- name: Extract Prometheus
  ansible.builtin.unarchive:
    src: /tmp/prometheus.tar.gz
    dest: /opt
    remote_src: yes

# Configure Prometheus
- name: Configure Prometheus
  ansible.builtin.template:
    src: prometheus.yml.j2
    dest: /opt/prometheus/prometheus.yml
  notify: Restart Prometheus

# Prometheus configuration (prometheus.yml.j2)
global:
  scrape_interval: 15s

scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'traefik'
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['localhost:8080']
  - job_name: 'ml_models'
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['{{ hostvars["mri_server"]["ansible_host"] }}:8000', '{{ hostvars["ct_server"]["ansible_host"] }}:8000']
```

This configuration sets up Traefik as a reverse proxy and load balancer for your ML services, with Prometheus monitoring both Traefik and the ML services. Traefik automatically handles load balancing between multiple instances of each ML service, while Prometheus collects metrics from both Traefik and the ML services.

Key points to emphasize in your interviews:

1. Ansible allows for consistent, repeatable deployments across multiple servers.
2. Traefik provides dynamic load balancing and routing for ML services.
3. Prometheus integration enables real-time monitoring of both infrastructure and ML model performance.
4. This setup allows for easy scaling of ML services by adding new servers to the Ansible inventory and Traefik configuration.
5. The combination of Ansible, Traefik, and Prometheus provides a robust, scalable, and observable MLOps infrastructure suitable for critical healthcare applications.

By implementing this configuration management approach, you demonstrate a comprehensive understanding of MLOps best practices, including infrastructure as code, load balancing, and monitoring, which are crucial for managing medical imaging AI systems in healthcare environments.
