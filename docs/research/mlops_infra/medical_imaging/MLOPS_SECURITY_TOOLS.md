# MLOps Security Notes: LDAP Integration and Vault Development

## LDAP Integration

1. Authentication:

   - Configure LDAP authentication for ML platforms:

     ```yaml
     ldap:
       host: ldap.hospital.com
       port: 389
       bind_dn: cn=admin,dc=hospital,dc=com
       bind_password: ${LDAP_ADMIN_PASSWORD}
       user_search_base: ou=users,dc=hospital,dc=com
     ```

2. Authorization:

   - Map LDAP groups to ML platform roles:

     ```yaml
     role_mappings:
       - ldap_group: cn=data_scientists,ou=groups,dc=hospital,dc=com
         platform_role: model_developer
       - ldap_group: cn=ml_engineers,ou=groups,dc=hospital,dc=com
         platform_role: model_deployer
     ```

3. User Provisioning:

   - Automate user creation based on LDAP attributes:

     ```python
     def provision_user(ldap_user):
         username = ldap_user.get('uid')
         email = ldap_user.get('mail')
         create_ml_platform_user(username, email)
     ```

4. Access Control:

   - Implement LDAP-based access control for ML resources:

     ```python
     def check_access(user, resource):
         user_groups = get_ldap_groups(user)
         return any(group in ALLOWED_GROUPS for group in user_groups)
     ```

## Vault Development

1. Secrets Management:

   - Store sensitive ML model parameters:

     ```sh
     vault kv put secret/ml-models/mri-classifier \
       learning_rate=0.001 \
       dropout_rate=0.5
     ```

2. Dynamic Credentials:

   - Generate temporary database credentials for data preprocessing:

     ```sh
     vault read database/creds/mri-preprocessing-role
     ```

3. Encryption:

   - Encrypt sensitive medical data:

     ```sh
     vault write transit/encrypt/patient-data \
       plaintext=$(base64 <<< "sensitive patient info")
     ```

4. PKI:

   - Issue certificates for secure model serving:

     ```sh
     vault write pki/issue/ml-serving-cert \
       common_name=model-server.hospital.com
     ```

## MLOps Lifecycle Integration

1. Data Ingestion:

   - Use LDAP for data source authentication
   - Retrieve database credentials from Vault

2. Data Preprocessing:

   - Encrypt sensitive data using Vault's transit engine
   - Use LDAP groups to control access to raw data

3. Model Development:

   - Authenticate data scientists using LDAP
   - Store model hyperparameters in Vault

4. Model Training:

   - Use Vault to securely pass GPU cluster credentials
   - Implement LDAP-based access control for training resources

5. Model Evaluation:

   - Store evaluation metrics securely in Vault
   - Use LDAP to control access to evaluation results

6. Model Deployment:

   - Use Vault to manage deployment credentials
   - Implement LDAP-based approvals for production deployments

7. Monitoring:

   - Use LDAP for authenticating monitoring dashboards
   - Store alert thresholds securely in Vault

## Best Practices

1. LDAP:

   - Use LDAPS (LDAP over SSL) for secure communication
   - Implement least privilege access control
   - Regularly audit LDAP group memberships

2. Vault:

   - Use Vault's audit logging for all secret access
   - Implement Vault policies for fine-grained access control
   - Rotate secrets regularly using Vault's dynamic secrets feature

3. Integration:

   - Use Vault's LDAP auth method for unified authentication
   - Implement periodic LDAP synchronization with ML platforms
   - Use Vault's response wrapping for secure secret distribution

## Example: Secure Model Training Pipeline

```python
import hvac
import ldap

def secure_train_model(user, model_params):
    # Authenticate user
    if not ldap_authenticate(user):
        raise AuthenticationError("Invalid credentials")

    # Check authorization
    if not check_ldap_group(user, "ml_training_group"):
        raise AuthorizationError("User not authorized for model training")

    # Retrieve sensitive parameters from Vault
    client = hvac.Client(url='https://vault.hospital.com:8200')
    client.auth.ldap.login(username=user.username, password=user.password)

    secret_params = client.secrets.kv.v2.read_secret_version(
        path='ml-models/mri-classifier'
    )['data']['data']

    # Merge secret params with input params
    full_params = {**model_params, **secret_params}

    # Train model
    trained_model = train_mri_classifier(full_params)

    # Store model securely
    store_model_securely(trained_model, user)

    return "Model trained and stored securely"

def store_model_securely(model, user):
    # Generate temporary S3 credentials
    s3_creds = client.secrets.aws.generate_credentials(
        name='ml-model-storage-role'
    )['data']

    # Upload model using temporary credentials
    upload_to_s3(model, s3_creds)

    # Log the action
    client.write('sys/audit-hash', input=f"User {user.username} stored model")
```

These notes provide a comprehensive overview of integrating LDAP and Vault into the MLOps lifecycle for medical imaging AI. It covers key security aspects across the entire pipeline, from data ingestion to model deployment and monitoring. By implementing these practices, you'll demonstrate a strong understanding of security considerations in MLOps.
